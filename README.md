# Online-Review-Spammers-Project
  Reviews play a crucial role in deciding business of any E-commerce websites. To be more precise, more than half of the customers will depend on reviews provided by previously used consumers to make decisions. So, genuineness in those reviews is a key aspect to look on for making satisfactory decisions for new customers and thus planned a proposal to work on Amazon movie review data. My main goal here is to detect whether a review is an inaccurate review to its star rating, or a spam review that skews the rating of a movie in a certain direction and flagging it, thus allowing a user to make a more accurately informed decision when making a movie selection.
